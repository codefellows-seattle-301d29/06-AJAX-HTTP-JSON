# AJAX, HTTP, and JSON

**Author**: Nicole and Taylor
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application renders blog articles on our webpage. This time around, these blog articles are being pulled from a 'server' and stored locally and then rendered on the page.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user would begin with an index.html site which provides the scaffolding for the web page, create CSS files to add style to the page, create a article.js file which handles the instantiating of article objects, and an articleView.js which basically kicks everything off on the page by showing or hiding everything.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used HTML, CSS, JSON, JavaScript, Local Storage, a 'server', jQuery, and Handlebars.
