## Overview
This project is an exercise in making AJAX requests, handling the response and displaying the results. On top of this we added a layer of efficiency by setting the AJAX data response set to local storage and then first checking if local storage had the data.

## Getting Started
The first step is making an AJAX request and logging the data from here you want to display the data. after you're able to do this you need to set your local storage variable and then create a function that renders your data in your local storage if it exists.

## Architecture
We utilized Github, HTML, Javascript, Jquery and more specifically AJAX calls, JSON Data and local storage
