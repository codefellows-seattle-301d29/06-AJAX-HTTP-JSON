# Project Name

**Author**: Ahmed Ali & Keith Eckert
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
 We are building a app, that we want to be able to load articles from hackerIpsum.json so that we don't need to keep all of the articles in local storage.

## Getting Started
The user must first fork this repository. Once the repo is forked, the user must clone their new repo onto their machine. From there, the user can open the site using the index.html or using live-server.


## Architecture
We used Javascript, HTML & CSS, using Normalize to reset the browser settings and Iconomoon for icons.The CSS files are sectioned into three sections: base, layout, modules, and state. The JSON file include hackerIpsum.json (with the raw data), article.js (which instantiates objects).

## Change Log
01-17-2018 12:00pm - Articles succesfully are retrieved with AJAX, then loaded and rendered

## Credits and Collaborations
Normalize CSS reset, Iconomoon.
