#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Brian and I (Christian) paired together. It took about 3 hours.**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each feature task:  
  1. First, we started on reading the review items/filling in the comment sections. 
  2. Next, we completed the if statement inside the fetchAll() method by parsing localStorage.rawData on the loadAll() method. 
  3. Next, we completed the else statement in the fetchAll() method by setting a localStorage item to 'rawData', and stringifying the data, then passing data into the loadAll() method.
