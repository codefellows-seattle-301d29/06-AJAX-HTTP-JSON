#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each feature task:  
  1. First, we reviewed the "review" items and added comments where indicated.
  2. Next, we worked on the article.js file, specifically the if/else statement. To make this assignment work, we needed to update the index.html page and make sure we were calling the correct method on the articleView.js file.
  3. We verified that the page load worked with both the ajax call and local storage.
